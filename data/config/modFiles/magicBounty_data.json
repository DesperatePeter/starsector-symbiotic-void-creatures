Unfortunately, nobody seems to have any idea where they came from, what they are and what drives them.\nBut we did at the very least manage to learn on thing: They appear to reproduce via some sort of hive-queen.\nOur hope is that eliminating said queen could stop, or at the very least slow down, their spread throughout the sector.\nAnd who knows, maybe eliminating the queen might even help uncover some of their secrets.\nGiven that you have already dealt with these voidlings before, I can think of no better candidate for this job!",
