""Don't even know who our employer was, or where these creatures came from. Well, not for sure, anyhow. Some thought 't was some heretic trying to profit off of Ludd's punishment for our sins, or some spiritual bullshit. Others were convinced it was a tri-tach bioengineering project. There were rumors about some Sindrian lobster experiments.""

""Personally, I think some brain-fried pirate might have stumbled onto something that should've better been left buried somewhere in the outer sector.""

Heh, who could've guessed that trying to control a swarm of space predators, trying to make them more aggressive, trying to make them hunter fleets, could backfire. Don't get me wrong, we did succeed. Real nice and aggressive, these hunters.""

The man shrugs, suddenly appearing a little bit more sober.

""Don't wanna bore you with all the little details. Maybe don't wanna bother myself with 'em. Long story short, most of my team died. The few others that survived seem to have disappeared shortly after. Only reason I'm still kicking's that I chose to disappear myself, first chance I had. Presumed KIA. Not sure I did myself a favor.""

The man pauses for a second.

""Controlling voidlings isn't all that hard. Making them hunt fleets sure as hell isn't. But keeping a whole swarm, one with multiple alphas at that, from hunting your fleet, now that, that is impossible. Quickly after, whoever was in charge of this whole thing seemed to be very eager to erase all traces of the project, or at least their involvement, from history.""",svcmod_hunter_bar_event5:Continue,

""Guess they hoped the problem of roaming voidlings would just magically disappear. For all I know, even the hunter fleets are still roaming the outer periphery of the sector, looking for big juicy fleets to hunt.""

""The equipment we used to try to control them might even still be intact.""

The man clears his throat.

""Well, that's about all I know. And now let an old man drink in solitude.""

He pours the rest of his schnapps into a shot glass, downs it and gestures towards the bar:

The man remains silent for a moment, thinking.

The man briefly stares at you with a troubled look on his face.
