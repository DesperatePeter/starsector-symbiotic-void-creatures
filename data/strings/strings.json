Apparently they are known as Symbiotic Void Creatures, or Voidlings.\nHe seems to know little more than that. \n\nNext time you dock, it might be worth checking checking the portside bar for rumors.\n\nAt this point, your science officer approaches you - visibly enthusiastic. He immediately begins to show you diagrams with details about nervous systems and nutrition levels.\nIt doesn't take more than a brief, intense stare to remind him to give you the executive summary rather than all the technical details:\n\n It should be possible to control these creatures if you had some expertise in the handling of automated ships.",
