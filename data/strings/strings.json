    "svc_voidlings_defeated_text_continue" : "He appears to have heard rumors about the creatures you encountered. Apparently they are known as Symbiotic Void Creatures, or Voidlings.\nHe seems to know little more than that. \n\nNext time you dock, it might be worth checking checking the portside bar for rumors.\n\nAt this point, your science officer approaches you - visibly enthusiastic. He immediately begins to show you diagrams with details about nervous systems and nutrition levels.\nIt doesn't take more than a brief, intense stare to remind him to give you the executive summary rather than all the technical details:\n\nThese creatures are of unknown origin, have unknown gene sequences, that show signs of possible bioengineering efforts, and apparently have the special ability to make science officers very excited.",

It was more aggressive, actively seeking your fleet out in hyperspace, as if driven by hunger. \n\nAn analysis of the carcasses indicates the presence of some sort of cybernetic components. \nUpon brief inspection, your science officer declares that this appears to be some sort of control mechanism. They assure you that they will find a way to reverse-engineer the technology.",
