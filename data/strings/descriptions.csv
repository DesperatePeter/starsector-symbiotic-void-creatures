The special particles that form this ink cloud seem to attract and absorb all kinds of energy, significantly reducing the effectiveness of beams, causing missiles engines to flame out and even being able to slightly reduce the impact energy of projectiles. This weapon is inexplicably easy to mount on a regular ship.

svc_bioplasma_large,WEAPON,"Not unlike the plasma cannon, this weapon fires superheated balls of a plasma-like slime. Very much unlike the plasma cannon, these balls are fired in pairs of two, which are tethered together via some sort of slime cord, resulting in rather erratic, bola-like, projectile movement. This makes the weapon surprisingly effective against smaller targets at medium ranges, but is truly devestating when fired against large targets at close range. When impacting armor or hull, the slime clogs thrusters and barrels, briefly reducing the target's maneuverability and rate of fire,",General,,,

svc_embolist,SHIP,"The Embolist's predatory strategy revolves around identifying and infiltrating void organisms that traverse the cosmos. As its target comes into proximity, the creature releases microscopic, nearly invisible tendrils that extend towards the host, seeking weak points in their protective barriers. With uncanny precision, it pierces through the host's defences, injecting specialized enzymes that immobilize the organism and subdue its immune response.

Once attached, Embolists utilize their modified mouthparts to tap into the host's circulatory system, extracting vital nutrients and sustenance necessary for their own survival. It co-opts the host's physiology, exploiting their resources while exerting control over their actions, essentially turning them into puppets manipulated by the parasitic voidling's sinister agenda.

Over time, Embolists propagate within their hosts, reproducing by laying eggs within the creature's body cavities. These eggs hatch, giving rise to a new generation of parasitic progeny that continue the cycle of infestation and domination. Eventually, the host succumbs to the Embolists's draining presence, becoming a mere vessel for the perpetuation of the parasite's existence.",,,,

After overwhelming the seemingly biomechanical, frigate sized creature and recovering its remains, the scientists present identified organs with functions similar to phase coils. Truly a marvel of evolution and a great mystery to be explored.
