svc_bge_grappler,WEAPON,This orifice houses a tendril. When the tendril extends it enters P-Space reaching tremendous speeds through time-dilation making it look like a beam. Through unknown means it accelerates the creature when the tendril latches onto its prey.,,,,
svc_bge_grappler_pd,WEAPON,This orifice houses a tendril. Though similar to Grappler Tendrils this pseudopod is specialized to attack small fast moving targets with a whip-like slash causing very high impact force.,,,,
svc_acidthrower,WEAPON,"A mutated gland symbiote that emits acid capable of seeping behind shields. Extremely effective against certain hyperalloys commonly found within most types of armor but won't dissolve normal hull structure.

svc_fangcluster,WEAPON,"A mutated Voidling jaw functioning suspiciously similar to a common mass driver.
Rapidly regrows fangs which are then accelerated by powerful muscles through a puzzling mechanism, somehow matching or even exceeding modern needler designs.",Anti-Shield,,,
svc_inksac,WEAPON,"This organic gland produces and stores an odd chemical capable of heavy foaming on rapid energy transfer. Such ink like material is capable of dissipating large amounts of energy and can choke out most conventional technology, significantly reducing the effectiveness of beams, causing missile engines to flame out and even being able to slightly reduce the impact of energy projectiles. Mounting on a ship is possible with proper precautions like nutrients and sensory intake taken into account. Note: The AGC-tag BlockBeams is recommended for this weapon.",Anti-Beam,,,
svc_boltzmann_brain,WEAPON,"A spontaneously manifesting brain is launched towards the enemy, spewing electropsionic EMP blasts as it comes closer, which fries the brain in the process.",,,,
svc_worm_colony_large,WEAPON,"Numerous phaseworms call this growth their home and they will protect their host fiercely. The nest looks somewhat like wasp hives from Old-Earth. When phaseworms collide with an enemy ship they creep on board, wreaking havoc among the crew and sensitive systems.",,,,

svc_bioplasma_large,WEAPON,"Not unlike the plasma cannon, this weapon fires superheated balls of a plasma-like slime. Very much unlike the plasma cannon, these balls are fired in pairs of two, which are tethered together via some sort of slime cord, resulting in rather erratic, bola-like, projectile movement. This makes the weapon surprisingly effective against smaller targets at medium ranges, but is truly devestating when fired against large targets at close range.",General,,,

svc_parasumbilical_cord,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Attaches a parasumbilical cord to an enemy, diverting a part of the damage taken to the enemy. Will break if the enemy moves out of range.",,,,
svc_nervous_shunt,SHIP_SYSTEM,Negates all damage for a few seconds after which all damage received during that time is applied at once.,,,,
svc_volatile_void_drones,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates pain receptors in certain drones agitating them so much that they immediatly seek out the next enemy and ram themselves against them, dying in the process.",,,,
svc_torid_drones,SHIP_SYSTEM,Releases a defensive Torid drone to protect its host.,,,,
parry,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Reflects all projectiles and unguided missiles for a brief time. Can only parry a certain amount of damage, based on OP. Once that threshold is exceeded, projectiles get stopped rather than parried.",,,,

svc_embolist,SHIP,"This putrid creature, almost blind by nature, makes use of a mutated proboscis to prod targets it believes to be food. If the impailed object retaliates a heavy payload of digestive fluids and larvae are swiftly injected. Subsequent dissolved organic matter serves as excellent feed for both the host and emergent spawn.",,,,
svc_hemalisk,SHIP,"A particularly hostile monster even compared to its peers, Hemalisk's extreme metabolism and rabid aggression allows staggering physical abilities far beyond its size class. Some specimens have been observed feasting on non living matter such as hulls, likely due to its impossible energy requirements.",,,,
svc_keratinos,SHIP,"These gigantic creatures guard breeding grounds but are sometimes seen hunting together with other Voidlings.
(placeholder description)",,,,
svc_lephantis,SHIP,"The largest and most intricate symbiote currently documented, a Lephantis uses its massive lung-like appendages to produce and store potent pheromones. These pheromones serve a dual purpose, enhancing physical and mental capabilities while also guiding symbiotes and individuals with weaker perception.",,,,
svc_pupacyst,SHIP,"This species, known as a cultivator or surrogate, is responsible for nest building, transporting, and nurturing of smaller symbiotes.  Its parallel evolution to the Torid paired with an overdeveloped brain for its size allows precise and adaptable tactics unlike what one would expect from such a creature.",,,,
svc_toxocyst,SHIP,"The Toxicus Cysta, also known as Toxocyst by spacers, was first found by the exploratory fleet Numinous-Exa-5 as they were traversing an unusual asteroid field in the [redacted] system, circa c+199. The species was discovered when one such specimen successfully ambushed and destroyed a lasher-class frigate, part of the expedition and acting as a forward scout, all 25 souls onboard were deemed lost.  

After overwhelming the seemingly biomechanical, frigate sized creature and recovering its remains, the scientists present identified organs with functions similar to phase coils. Truly a marvel of evolution and a great mystery to be explored. 

Even to this day these creatures remain elusive at best and most think they are but fabricated fables to keep people out of the scavenge-filled fringes.",,,,

svc_mios,SHIP,Mios drones seem to be closely related to Embolist void creatures judging by their general appearance. Perhaps they are a larval form nurtured by surrogate ceatures which would make sense given the Embolist's parasitic nature.,,,,
svc_pox,SHIP,Pox are basically just a nervous system attached to 2 chemical-filled sacs that explode when these chemicals come into contact with each other. These lesser voidlings are controlled entirely by their mother organism suggesting they're capable of some kind of telepathy.,,,,

svc_stjarwhal_calf,SHIP,"This titanic organism is part of a relatively unknown species of cosmic protozoa, commonly mistaken for ""space whales"" which is an ancient spacer myth that started during the early expansion epoch. This individual is a pup of its species, as indicated by the size and shape. During this stage in its life cicle it has evolved neither male nor female attributes.

Stjarwhals are peaceful filter-feeders, relying on their huge body size and numbers to drive off predators while the larger ones protect the young. They are highly intelligent and social creatures, similar to old-earth dolphin species. The whales have been observed to recognize people on spaceships they've encountered before and will act according to they treated them in previous encounters. Stjarwhals even travel alongside fleets whose captain they deem friendly.

So far nobody has been able to identify what these gigantic unicelled organisms are filtering from the void to feed on or how they are able to recognize humans behind thick walls of armour on spaceships. They ""swim"" around in space through a fascinatingly complex method that seems impossible by contemporary scientific knowledge which even gives them hyperspace capability, where herds of whales can be encountered most commonly.",,,,
