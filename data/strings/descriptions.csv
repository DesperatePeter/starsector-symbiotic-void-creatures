svc_fangcluster,WEAPON,"A mutated Voidling jaw functioning suspiciously similar to a common mass driver.
Rapidly regrows fangs which are then accelerated by powerful muscles through a puzzling mechanism, somehow matching or even exceeding modern needler designs.",,,,,
svc_inksac,WEAPON,"This organic gland produces and stores an odd chemical capable of heavy foaming on rapid energy transfer. Such ink like material is capable of dissipating large amounts of energy and can choke out most conventional technology, significantly reducing the effectiveness of beams, causing missile engines to flame out and even being able to slightly reduce the impact of energy projectiles. Mounting on a ship is possible with proper precautions like nutrients and sensory intake taken into account.",,,,,
svc_boltzmann_brain,WEAPON,"A spontaneously manifesting brain is launched towards the enemy, spewing electropsionic EMP blasts as it comes closer, which fries the brain in the process.",,,,,

svc_biomemetism,SHIP_SYSTEM,Impossibly swift neural connections let the creature experience time differently enabling lightning-fast reflexes.,,,,,

svc_spooky_action,SHIP_SYSTEM,NODESCRIPTION...YET,,,,,
,,,,,,,
svc_arbiter,SHIP,"Arbiters serve as p-space relays for the waves sent out by Lephantis Tyrant organisms and thus act as a beacon within a swarm or hunting party. They play a similar role to higher-ranking officers in human fleets, relaying orders and keeping their subordinates in check. This overseer ability goes so far that it can force smaller Voidlings to sacrifice themselves by forming living shields against incoming fire.",,,,,
svc_embolist,SHIP,"This putrid creature, almost blind by nature, makes use of a mutated proboscis to prod targets it believes to be food. If the impailed object retaliates a heavy payload of digestive fluids and larvae are swiftly injected. Subsequent dissolved organic matter serves as excellent feed for both the host and emergent spawn.",,,,,
svc_hemalisk,SHIP,"A particularly hostile monster even compared to its peers, Hemalisk's extreme metabolism and rabid aggression allows staggering physical abilities far beyond its size class. Some specimens have been observed feasting on non living matter such as hulls, likely due to its impossible energy requirements.",,,,,
svc_keratinos,SHIP,"This specimen sports an exceptionally resilient carapace, notably exceeding the armor density of most sector-standard warships. Additionally, Keratinos possess a decentralized nervous system analogous to a diffuse nerve net, reminiscent of ancient marine organisms. 
Combat records shows how this distributed neural architecture severely complicates incapacitation efforts, with numerous recorded incidents of reanimation despite critical injury.",,,,,
svc_lephantis,SHIP,"The largest and most intricate symbiote currently documented, a Lephantis uses its massive lung-like appendages to produce vibrations in phase space. These vibrations serve a dual purpose, enhancing physical and mental capabilities while also guiding symbiotes and individuals with weaker perception.",,,,,
svc_pupacyst,SHIP,"This species, known as a cultivator or surrogate, is responsible for nest building, transporting, and nurturing of smaller symbiotes.  Its parallel evolution to the Mios paired with an overdeveloped brain for its size allows precise and adaptable tactics unlike what one would expect from such a creature. Pupacysts are unique in their ability to transport antimatter fuel. They possess a specialized organ permanently located in p-space, an evolution that contradicts current hyperphysics theories.",,,,,
svc_toxocyst,SHIP,"The Toxicus Cysta, also known as Toxocyst by spacers, was first found by the exploratory fleet Numinous-Exa-5 as they were traversing an unusual asteroid field in the [redacted] system, circa c+199. The species was discovered when one such specimen successfully ambushed and destroyed a lasher-class frigate, part of the expedition and acting as a forward scout, all 25 souls onboard were deemed lost.  

After overwhelming the seemingly biomechanical, frigate sized creature and recovering its remains, the scientists present identified organs with functions similar to phase coils. Truly a marvel of evolution and a great mystery to be explored. 

Even to this day these creatures remain elusive at best and most think they are but fabricated fables to keep people out of the scavenge-filled fringes.",,,,,

This individual is a pup of its species, as indicated by the size and shape. During this stage in its life cicle it has evolved neither male nor female attributes.
