# Symbiotic Void Creatures

A Starsector mod that adds biological creatures as enemies.
These mysterious creatures, known as symbiotic void creatures, can be encountered roaming uninhabited systems.

They feature custom animations, weapons and ship systems. A select few of these weapons can be looted and installed in
regular ships. With the automated ships skill, it is also possible to recover defeated voidlings to use them in your fleet.

## Roadmap

Currently, this mod is in a very early development stage. There are many more planned features to let you slowly unveil
the mystery behind these creatures and interact with them in more different ways.

Future features will likely include:

- Special missions involving protecting something against voidlings
- A voidling-nest to defeat
- Better rewards for defeating bounty missions
- New items, such as blueprints, industry-items that allow spawning/upgrading voidlings etc.
- Additional storytelling in quests
