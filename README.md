# Symbiotic Void Creatures

A Starsector mod that adds biological creatures as enemies.
These mysterious creatures, known as symbiotic void creatures, can be encountered roaming uninhabited systems.

They feature custom animations, weapons and ship systems. A select few of these weapons can be looted and installed in
regular ships. With the automated ships skill, it is also possible to recover defeated voidlings to use them in your fleet.

## Testing Instructions

This is an alpha release aimed at testers. This mod is currently feature-shallow and poorly balanced/tested.

This mod requires LazyLib, MagicLib and GraphicsLib. AdvancedGunneryControl is strongly suggested, as it improves Voidling AI.

While it is possible to add SVC to an ongoing campaign, it can't be removed, and it is recommended to start a new campaign with it.

To facilitate encountering the content, SVC fleet spawn rates are higher than what is intended for a release,
the mod will periodically print spawn information, including location, into the log and running the game in dev-mode will
drastically increase spawn rate and fleet count.
Note: Running dev-mode even for a few seconds will likely spam the entire sector with voidlings!

If you want to "speedrun" testing, you need to encounter and defeat a voidling fleet while exploring and then visit a bar,
 where you will get offered a magic bounty.

But we are also very much interested in hearing how you perceive SVC during a normal playthrough.

Thank you very much for taking the time to test this mod, we appreciate any feedback you might be able to provide!

### What kind of feedback?

We are aware that there's not enough features and rewards yet.
We are not yet looking to fine-tune balance, but if there are any glaring balance problems, please let us know!
How do the lootable weapons feel? 
Are there any big issues, technical or otherwise?

Of course, any kind of feedback is appreciated!

## Roadmap

Currently, this mod is in a very early development stage. There are many more planned features to let you slowly unveil
the mystery behind these creatures and interact with them in more different ways.

Future features will likely include:

- A voidling-nest to defeat
- Better rewards for defeating bounty missions
- New items, such as blueprints, industry-items that allow spawning/upgrading voidlings etc.
- Additional storytelling in quests
