# Symbiotic Void Creatures

A Starsector mod that adds biological creatures as enemies.
These mysterious creatures, known as symbiotic void creatures, can be encountered roaming uninhabited systems.

They feature custom animations, weapons and ship systems. A select few of these weapons can be looted and installed in
regular ships. With the automated ships skill, it is also possible to recover defeated voidlings to use them in your fleet.

## Building

Use gradle as a build system. Define the gradle setting "starsector.dir" and set it to your starsector installation folder.

Make sure you have the following mods in your starsector mod folder:

- Advanced Gunnery Control
- Console Commands
- Exotica Technologies
- GraphicsLib
- LazyLib
- LunaLib
- MagicLib
- Starship Legends
- Substance Abuse

To have access to the CommunityApiDocs, make sure to run "git submodule update --init".
